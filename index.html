      What a wonderful phrase Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze It means no worries For the rest of your daysIt's our problem-free philosophy
      Hakuna Matata! Why, when he was a young warthog When I was a young wart-hoooog! Very nice! Thanks! He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
      He could clear the Savannah after every meal I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
      And oh, the shame (He was ashamed!) Thought of changin' my name (Oh, what's in a name?) And I got downhearted (How did you feel?)
